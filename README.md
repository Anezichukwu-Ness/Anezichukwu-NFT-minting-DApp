# Plant a Tree, Save the Environment
This is a decentralized application for donating to a tree-planting campaign called 'Plant a Tree Save the Environment' through minting an NFT. The dapp has a collection of 10 NFTs, and each of them costs 0.01 MATIC. The funds raised from the minting these NFTs are for an organization in charge of tree planting. Only the organization can withdraw the donated funds.
## How it works

- Visit the campaign's website or platform where the NFTs are being sold.
- contribute to the campaign by minting an NFT for 0.01 MATIC each. 
- The funds raised from the sale of these NFTs will be used to plant trees in areas that need it most.
